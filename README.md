# Express API Project
The purpose of this week was to start my backend journey by creating an API using Express.

- How to build an API in Node using Express
- How to create routes in Express
- Continued to practice data manipulation - selecting, filtering, and limiting arrays in JavaScript. 

## Reflections
I learnt several terminal commands both for windows and ubuntu this week, and solved the issue of Heroku using Ubuntu by installing wls2 on my computer. This made me aim for the blue stretch goal this week. It took some time before I understood how to not overwrite a previous path with the next one, but once that was clearer I started to create a shows/search and shows/countries where I added some query params under each of them respectively.

I am looking forward to the coming weeks with backend and will put more time into the coming backend projects for sure!

If I had more time this week I would look into how to use Swagger for documentation and continue to practice data manipulation. 

My API uses a hardcoded JSON file that contains Netflix data.

Endpoints: 

* shows
* shows/search ---> query: director or title
* shows/countries -> query: country
* shows/:id
